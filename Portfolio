This database stores different colors of tee shirts sold at one store. I made a table titled "Store," with columns containg information about each item
such as the price, quantity in stock, and the aisle in which it is located. I then sorted the data by price- from lowest to highest, showed the maximum
price, and filtered the data by items that cost more than 10 dollars.  


#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE  price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)
#OR 
SELECT distinct product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select 
sum(Quantity), 
product, 
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select 
count(distinct cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
