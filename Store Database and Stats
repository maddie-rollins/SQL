This database stores different colors of tee shirts sold at one store. I made a table titled "Store," with columns containg information about each item
such as the price, quantity in stock, and the aisle in which it is located. I then sorted the data by price- from lowest to highest, showed the maximum
price, and filtered the data by items that cost more than 10 dollars.
